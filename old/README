A theme for the LaTeX beamer class based on the official AGH-UST
PowerPoint template.

Installation

    There are two ways to use beamer-AGH.

    1. Copy beamerthemeAGH* files to one of the TeX root directories
       (eg. to $TEXMF/tex/latex/AGH) and refresh the filename database.
    2. Copy beamerthemeAGH* files to the directory with the files that
       are being compiled.

Usage

    1. To load the theme, write \usetheme{AGH}
    2. To replace default Computer Modern typeface family with Latin
       Modern, write \usepackage{lmodern}
    3. To get English or Polish version of the title slide, write 
       \titleframe[en] or \titleframe[pl], respectively (instead of 
       \frame{\titlepage})
